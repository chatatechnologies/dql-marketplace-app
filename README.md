# dql-marketplace-app

# Overview

Deployable AutoQL solution by Chata is a platform to accelerate data-driven decision-making and eliminate repetitive reporting tasks. With AutoQL empower your non-technical users to access real-time data with ease, increase productivity and reduce the demand on the technical team â€“ all while ensuring the highest data security.

## About Google Click to Deploy

Popular open stacks on Kubernetes packaged by Google.

## Architecture

This application is a deployment of a stateful, deployable vm installation on a Kubernetes cluster and then installing the AutoQL services from the deployable VM.

# Installation

## Quick install with Google Cloud Marketplace

Get up and running with a few clicks! Install this Deployable AutoQL solution by Chata app to a Google
Kubernetes Engine cluster using Google Cloud Marketplace. Follow the
[on-screen instructions](<Link yet to be published>).

## Command line instructions

You can use [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) or a local
workstation to complete these steps.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](http://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/chatatechnologies/dql-marketplace-app&cloudshell_open_in_editor=README.md&cloudshell_working_dir=/)

### Prerequisites

#### Set up command-line tools

You'll need the following tools in your development environment. If you are
using Cloud Shell, `gcloud`, `kubectl`, Docker, and Git are installed in your
environment by default.

-   [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
-   [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
-   [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Configure `gcloud` as a Docker credential helper:

```shell
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

#### Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster

Create a new cluster from the command line:

```shell
export CLUSTER=dql-cluster
export ZONE=us-east1-b

gcloud container clusters create "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"
```

Configure `kubectl` to connect to the new cluster:

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"
```

#### Clone this repo

Clone this repo and the associated tools repo.

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chatatechnologies/dql-marketplace-app.git
```

#### Install the Application resource definition

An Application resource is a collection of individual Kubernetes components,
such as Services, Deployments, and so on, that you can manage as a group.

To set up your cluster to understand Application resources, run the following
command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-tools/master/crd/app-crd.yaml"
```

You need to run this command once.

The Application resource is defined by the
[Kubernetes SIG-apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps)
community. The source code can be found on
[github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application).

### Install the Application

#### Create namespace in your Kubernetes cluster

If you use a different namespace than `default`, run the command below to create
a new namespace:

```shell
kubectl create namespace "$NAMESPACE"
```

#### Create namespace, secrets and configmap in your Kubernetes cluster

Chata will provide you with a folder that has secert files and scripts to create the required secrets and configmaps. Follow the `Readme` provided with hem to set up the prerequisites.

Navigate to the `dql-marketplace-app` directory:

```shell
cd dql-marketplace-app
```

#### Configure the app with environment variables

Choose an instance name and
[namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
for the app. In most cases, you can use the `default` namespace.

```shell
export INSTANCE_NAME=dql-marketplace
export NAMESPACE=$NAMESPACE
```

Configure the container images:

```shell
TAG=1.0.1-gmp1
export DEPLOYABLE_VM_IMAGE="gcr.io/chataai-public/gcp-marketplace:${TAG}"
export DEPLOYER_IMAGE="gcr.io/chataai-public/gcp-marketplace/deployer:${TAG}"
```

The images above are referenced by
[tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag). We recommend
that you pin each image to an immutable
[content digest](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#content-digests).
This ensures that the installed application always uses the same images,
until you are ready to upgrade. To get the digest for the image, use the
following script:

```shell
for i in "SPARK_OPERATOR_IMAGE"; do
  repo=$(echo ${!i} | cut -d: -f1);
  digest=$(docker pull ${!i} | sed -n -e 's/Digest: //p');
  export $i="$repo@$digest";
  env | grep $i;
done
```

For the persistent disk used by the sample-app deployment, you will need to:

 * Set the StorageClass name. Check your available options using the command below:
   * ```kubectl get storageclass```
   * Or check how to create a new StorageClass in [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#the-storageclass-resource)


```shell
export STORAGE_CLASS="standard" # provide your StorageClass name if not "standard"
```

#### Following are the environment variables provided by Chata
RELEASE_VERSION 
INDEX_BUCKET 
INTEGRATOR_BUCKET 
INTEGRATOR_ID 
HELM_REPO_URL 
POST_DEPLOYMENTS_URL
PEM_SECRET 
JSON_SECRET 
JWT_SECRET

#### Following are the environment variables needed to be entered
PORTAL_SUBDOMAIN 
BACKEND_SUBDOMAIN 
WEBAPP_SUBDOMAIN 
EXCEL_SUBDOMAIN 
ADMIN_EMAIL 
ADMIN_FIRST_NAME 
ADMIN_LAST_NAME 
TLS_CERTIFICATE_VALUE 
TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_VALUE

**NOTE: The subdomains to be configured should should have valid domain entry and  `TLS_CERTIFICATE_VALUE`, `TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_VALUE` should be base64 encoded values.**

#### If you want to use spot instances and minimal resources, following are the environment variables needed to be entered

```shell
export SPOT_INSTANCES_ENABLED="true"
export REPLICAS_OVERRIDE_VALUE="1"
export CPU_OVERRIDE_VALUE="0.5"
```

#### Configure the service account

For the deployable vm to be able to manipulate Kubernetes resources, there must be a
service account in the target namespace with cluster-wide permissions to
manipulate Kubernetes resources.

To provision a service account and export it via an environment variable, run the
following command:

```shell
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT="${INSTANCE_NAME}-sa"
```

To create service accounts, expand the manifest:

```shell
cat resources/service-account.yaml \
  | envsubst '${INSTANCE_NAME} \
              ${NAMESPACE} \
              ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}' \
    > "${INSTANCE_NAME}_sa_manifest.yaml"
```

You can create the accounts on the cluster with `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f "${INSTANCE_NAME}_sa_manifest.yaml" \
    --namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
```

#### Expand the manifest template

Use `envsubst` to expand the template. We recommend that you save the
expanded manifest file for future updates to the app. If minimal resources are not needed, remove those from the below command.

```shell
awk 'FNR==1 {print "---"}{print}' manifest/* \
  | envsubst '$INSTANCE_NAME $NAMESPACE $DEPLOYABLE_VM_IMAGE $SERVICE_ACCOUNT $DEPLOYER_IMAGE $PORTAL_SUBDOMAIN $BACKEND_SUBDOMAIN $WEBAPP_SUBDOMAIN $EXCEL_SUBDOMAIN $ADMIN_EMAIL $ADMIN_FIRST_NAME $ADMIN_LAST_NAME $RELEASE_VERSION $INDEX_BUCKET $INTEGRATOR_BUCKET $INTEGRATOR_ID $SPOT_INSTANCES_ENABLED $HELM_REPO_URL $POST_DEPLOYMENTS_URL $REPLICAS_OVERRIDE_VALUE $STORAGE_CLASS $CPU_OVERRIDE_VALUE $TLS_CERTIFICATE_VALUE $TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_VALUE $PEM_SECRET $JSON_SECRET $JWT_SECRET' \
  > "${INSTANCE_NAME}_manifest.yaml"
```

#### Apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster

To apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster, use `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f "${INSTANCE_NAME}_manifest.yaml" --namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
```

#### View your app in the Google Cloud Console

To get the Cloud Console URL for your app, run the following command:

```shell
echo "https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/application/${ZONE}/${CLUSTER}/${NAMESPACE}/${INSTANCE_NAME}"
```

To view your app, open the URL in your browser.

By design, the removal of StatefulSets in Kubernetes does not remove
PersistentVolumeClaims that were attached to their Pods. This prevents your
installations from accidentally deleting stateful data.

To remove the PersistentVolumeClaim with their attached persistent disks, run
the following `kubectl` commands:

```shell
kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaims \
  --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
  --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=${INSTANCE_NAME}
```

### Delete the GKE cluster

Optionally, if you don't need the deployed application or the GKE cluster,
delete the cluster using this command:

```shell
gcloud container clusters delete "${CLUSTER}" --zone "${ZONE}"
```
